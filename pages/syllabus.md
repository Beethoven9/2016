Unprecedented advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th century is transforming science, including health and biomedical research. Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data analysis techniques of smaller datasets have been transformed recently by technologies that continue to expand the possibilities of observing and deciphering molecular entities in an unprecedented way. This course includes concepts from Statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering. We will use learn the necessary skills to manage and analyze data. We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, and high dimensional data analysis. We will also learn the necessary skill to develop data products including R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results.

#### Why take this course?
The goal of this course is to teach students to answer questions with data. To do this, we will learn the necessary skills to manage and analyze data with case studies. We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, and high dimensional data analysis. We will also learn the necessary skill to develop data products including R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results. All class material will be motivated with real life examples involving data. We will use the R programming language. Below are some of the concepts and skill we will cover. 

#### What is the structure of this course?
We will learn these concepts through six data analysis projects. Grades will be based on:

* 6 homeworks (30%)
* 2 midterms (15%)
* 1 final project (35%)
* participation in discussions (5%)

#### Prerequisites
Must have basic programming knowledge, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above

#### Required Textbook
None. Instead, we have a list of recommended readings on the web site.

#### Schedule 

This is a **TENTATIVE** schedule for the course.
