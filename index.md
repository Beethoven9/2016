<img src="figures/hubwayclustering.png" alt="Hubway Clustering" />

Unprecedented advances in digital technology during the second half of the 20th century is transforming science, including health and biomedical research. Scientific fields that have traditionally relied upon simple data analysis techniques of smaller datasets have been transformed recently by technologies that continue to expand the possibilities of observing and deciphering molecular entities in an unprecedented way. This course includes concepts from Statistics, Computer Science and Software Engineering. We will use learn the necessary skills to manage and analyze data. We will learn concepts such as exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, machine learning, and high dimensional data analysis. We will also learn the necessary skill to develop data products including R programming, data wrangling, reproducible research, and communicating results.

We will be using R for all programming assignments and projects. All [lectures will be posted here](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/2016/pages/lectures.html) and should be available 24 hours after meeting time.

The course is also listed as CSCI E-107.
